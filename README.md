<h2>Introduction</h2>

For our Minor Proejct 1, me and my team have decided to make an online disease diagnosis system. We have decided to go for a web-based application, and use Java for our backend. For the main working of our project, we initially aimed to employ Machine Learning for our project, but due to the restriction on imported libraries, we have explored other approaches. One of those approaches has given us better results than the others.
